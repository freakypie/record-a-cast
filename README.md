# record-a-cast [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/record-a-cast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/record-a-cast)

Record a portion of your desktop into a GIF

`record-a-cast` was created out of frustration for either poor UI, poor compatibility with Linux, or both. It's based on well-tested technologies (e.g. [Electron][], [FFmpeg][]) so it should work well on most environments.

This project's UI is based on Shutter's UI which we found intuitive and practical.

[Electron]: https://github.com/atom/electron
[FFmpeg]: https://www.ffmpeg.org/

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install record-a-cast`

```js
var recordAGif = require('record-a-cast');
recordAGif(); // 'awesome'
```
